- Run the r file ck and gk to load all the functions
- Gk3.1 and Gk3.2 will be run twice for both ionosphere and ringnorm individually. The data should be loaded separately for which the code is written at the beginning of both the files.
- pca4.R can be run in one go to get the plots and graphs.
- Heirarchial cluster can be run in one go to get the plots and graphs
- For calculating the error rates for heirarchial clustering, it might vary as the I50 is sampled  from the entire dataset.
- The function for initializing the centroids like kmeans++ is included in the extra.R along with the new EM_algo. The entire file can be run in one go to get the desired plots and graphs
